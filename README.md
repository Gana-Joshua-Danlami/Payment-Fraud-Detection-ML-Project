# ðŸ’³ Payment Fraud Detection: A Real-World ML Case Study

This project explores how machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent payment transactions, just like the systems used in real-world fintech. I didnâ€™t stop at just building the model, i investigated five high-confidence fraud cases, broke down what made them suspicious, and explained how the model caught what rule-based systems missed.

Tools used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn  
Focus: Fraud pattern detection, model thinking, real-case investigation  
Output: A simple model that *actually thinks*, not just flags.
