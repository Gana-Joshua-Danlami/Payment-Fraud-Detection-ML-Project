# 💳 Payment Fraud Detection: A Real-World ML Case Study

This project explores how machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent payment transactions, just like the systems used in real-world fintech. I didn’t stop at just building the model, I investigated five high-confidence fraud cases, broke down what made them suspicious, and explained how the model caught what rule-based systems missed.

Tools used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn  
Focus: Fraud pattern detection, model thinking, real-case investigation  
Output: A simple model that *actually thinks*, not just flags.

##  What's Inside This Repo

Here’s what you’ll find in this project:

- **Cleaned & Engineered Dataset**: All raw transactional data was processed and enhanced with meaningful features like `deltaOrig`, `isOrigEmptied`, and `balanceDiffRatio` to improve fraud detection.

- **Fraud Detection Model**: A simple Logistic Regression model trained to classify suspicious transactions using our engineered features.

- **Real Fraud Case Investigations**: We didn’t just train the model. We *listened* to it. We took 5 fraud predictions and investigated them like a real fraud analyst would, showing the “why” behind each red flag.

- **Model Thinking Summaries**: Every case has a layman-friendly summary of what likely triggered the model’s decision. Think of it like peeking inside the brain of your fraud detection system.

- **Reflections & Learnings**: This wasn’t just about accuracy scores. We documented bugs, stress moments, disconnects, breakthroughs, and the human experience behind the project.

All code is beginner-friendly and well-commented so you can follow along, fork it, or build on top of it.

##  Key Results & Insights

I focused less on fancy metrics and more on *practical fraud detection*.

###  Our Model Did the Job
- Achieved **100% precision** on fraud predictions; every transaction it flagged as fraud was indeed fraud.
- Caught **high-risk transactions** that were missed by the rule-based `isFlaggedFraud` system.

###  The Power of Simple Features
Our strongest fraud signals weren’t complex:

- `isOrigEmptied` (Was the origin account drained?)
- `balanceDiffRatio` (Did destination balance behave oddly?)
- `isHighRiskType` (Was it a TRANSFER or CASH_OUT?)

Simple logic. Big wins.

### 🕵🏽‍♂ I Investigated the Cases
I picked the **top 5 fraud predictions** with 100% confidence and dove into them one by one.

For each case, I explained:
- Why the model likely flagged it.
- How it compared to the traditional fraud flag.
- What real-world fraud scenario it resembles.

## ⚙️ How to Use This Project

Whether you're a beginner trying to learn or a pro looking to contribute, here’s how to get started:

1. **Clone this repo** or download the `.ipynb` notebook.
2. Open it in your preferred Jupyter environment (JupyterLab, Google Colab, JupyterLite, etc).
3. Run the cells step by step, everything is explained in plain English.
4. Check the “Top 5 Fraud Investigations” section to see how I broke down real fraudulent transactions using model predictions and domain logic.
5. Feel free to tweak the thresholds, add new features, or try out other classification models.

This notebook was written for humans, not just machines, so anyone curious can follow along.

And yes, contributions are welcome ✌🏽

##  Problem Statement & Objective

Every day, banks process millions of transactions, most are legitimate, but some are fraudulent. Traditional systems use fixed rules to flag suspicious activity, but they often miss new fraud patterns or raise false alarms. That's where machine learning comes in.

**The core objective of this project is simple yet crucial:**
> Can we build a machine learning model that detects fraud better than existing rule-based systems?

To explore this, I:
- Cleaned and transformed a large financial transactions dataset.
- Engineered features to highlight suspicious behavior.
- Trained a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Investigated the top fraud cases that the model confidently caught.
- Compared the model’s performance against the system's fraud flag.

> This project is less about building a fancy dashboard and more about **technical fraud detection**, digging into what makes fraud tick and how machine learning can help us stay one step ahead.

##  Final Thoughts (A Quick Reflection)

This project pushed me beyond just writing code. From runtime disconnections to unexpected bugs, every frustration was a hidden lesson that deepened my understanding of not just Python, but *thinking like a fraud analyst*. I now know this codebase top to bottom, and that kind of hands-on sweat is something no tutorial can teach.

(I'm telling the full story bugs, breakdowns, breakthroughs  on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gana-joshua-danlami-the-analyst-331156331/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@ganajoshuadanlami), and [X](https://x.com/joshofTP). Stay tuned.)
